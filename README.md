### Analytics

We use Firebase Analytics (provided by Google) to collect anonymous usage statistics, including the number of active users, session counts, and general device information (such as device model, operating system version, and country). This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify individual users.

No advertising identifiers are collected. This information is used solely to improve the app experience and understand usage patterns.

## Data Storage and Security

## Third-Party Services

The app connects to external APIs to:

- Display product information
- Show store locations
- Retrieve current specials and prices

These requests include your general location (when searching for stores) but no personally identifiable information.

The app uses Firebase Analytics (a Google service) to collect anonymous, aggregated usage data. For more information on how Google processes this data, see [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Data Sharing

We do NOT:

- Sell your data to third parties
- Share your personal information with advertisers
- Track your behavior for marketing purposes

Anonymous, aggregated usage statistics are collected via Firebase Analytics to help us improve the app. This data cannot identify individual users.

## Your Rights

You can:

- **Delete your data** at any time by deleting individual loyalty cards or uninstalling the app
- **Deny permissions** for camera or location (some features will be limited)
- **Use the app offline** for viewing saved loyalty cards
